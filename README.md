### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer, with a keen interest in technology and a drive to learn. I am passionate about software engineering and design, and look forward to working on new professional projects in the future.

I began studying Python in early 2023, utilising lectures provided by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Open Courseware, before completing an Introduction to JavaScript course with Code First Girls, in which I also learned HTML and CSS. During this course I built a movie quiz app, and received a certificate for being a highly commended candidate. I am currently enrolled in a software engineering bootcamp with HyperionDev, with an average grade of 100%.

In my spare time I enjoy running and cycling, using races to raise money for charity. In 2022 I raised over Â£600 for CALM running the Great South Run, and partook in a 50 mile bicycle race, raising money for Challengers Farnham. 

Please donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch, I am always open to make more connections and expand my network.
